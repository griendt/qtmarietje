### Dependencies
QtMarietje uses the following packages to run:
 - PyQt4
 - numpy
 - matplotlib
 - eyed3 (optional)

### Usage
qtmarietje.pyw [-H host] [-p port] [-d dir] [-u username]
The default settings are as follows:
 - Host: noordlset.science.ru.nl
 - Port: 1337
 - Directory: .pymarietje
 - User: The first line in local file "username" if it exists;
 otherwise the os login name is attempted.

A file "uploads_[user]" is read (or created if it doesn't exists) which contains a list of track IDs that have been queued under user [user] previously.
To generate a file, visit https://noordslet.science.ru.nl/unique.php?login=[user].
